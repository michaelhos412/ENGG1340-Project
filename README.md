Problem statement ( including assumptions and problem setting )

Nowadays , people tend to overlook the amount they spend in every transaction and have no efficient way to keep track of their expenses
our aim is that to create a program that will help people to keep track of their expenses and keep them all in one place
our program functions include : ( this one change a bit if u want to change all its also ok )

1. Add records of income and expenses

2. Records containing basic info:
  -Amount
  -Date
  -Type of Income (+)  (e.g. job, allowance , winning a lottery , etc) / Expense (-)  (e.g. food , leisure , laundry , etc )
  -Account ( how many user accounts e.g. cash , credit card , octopus , apps , etc)

3. Records can be edited and deleted at any time 

4. Users can view records by date , type and account (Searching with filter)

5. System should provide statistical report of userâ€™s financial state ( so basically everything di total and di sort kyk monthly report gtu)

6. Budget setting ( ya batasin aja trs systemnya bakal alert kalo over expense sama pas udah mau reach expense ) (can also set daily budget and give alert when the user exceeds the limit ) 
  -How much u have spent (show the percentage) "tracking the total more often?" 
  
the 6 above here are the basic functions of the program , maybe u want to add anything to explain a bit ??? up to u

7. Weekly saving goals (give congratulations if the goal is reached) (related to budget setting but this is if user spends below budget , the system will alert the user to keep up the good work , negative budget setting)
