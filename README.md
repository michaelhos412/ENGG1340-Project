Problem statement ( including assumptions and problem setting )

Nowadays, people are too busy to take notes of their expenses in traditional way such as writing it in the books. Therefore, we want to develop a program that will help people to keep track of their expenses and keep them all in one place

Our program include functions below:

1. Add records of user income and expenses

2. Records containing basic info:
  -Amount (in HKD with 2 decimal places)
  -Date (ddmmyyyy)
  -Type (income/expense)
  -Account ( cash , debit card , octopus card)
  -Ctaegory (food, transportation, utilities, other)

3. Records can be edited (added or deleted) at any time 

4. Users can view records by type, account, category, and amount in each date (Search by filtering)

5. System should provide statistical report of userâ€™s financial state weekly

6. Budget setting ( set weekly budget and give alert when the user exceeds the limit) 
 

7. Weekly saving goals (give congratulations if the goal is reached) (related to budget setting but this is if user spends below budget , the system will alert the user to keep up the good work)
